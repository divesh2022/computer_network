### üîÅ Logistic Regression Algorithm (Simplified)

1. **Prepare Data**  
   - Collect input features and binary labels (0 or 1).

2. **Initialize Parameters**  
   - Set initial weights and bias (usually to zero).

3. **Define Sigmoid Function**  
   - `sigmoid(z)` returns a value between 0 and 1, used to convert raw predictions into probabilities.

4. **Make Predictions**  
   - For each input, compute `z = dot_product(weights, features) + bias`.  
   - Apply `sigmoid(z)` to get predicted probability.

5. **Calculate Loss**  
   - Use a loss function like binary cross-entropy to measure prediction error.

6. **Compute Gradients**  
   - Find how much each weight and bias contributes to the error.

7. **Update Parameters**  
   - Adjust weights and bias using gradient descent:
     - `weights = weights - learning_rate * gradient_weights`
     - `bias = bias - learning_rate * gradient_bias`

8. **Repeat Steps 4‚Äì7**  
   - Loop for a fixed number of iterations or until the loss is small.

9. **Classify Output**  
   - If predicted probability ‚â• 0.5, classify as 1; else classify as 0.

# Naive Bais

- Look at past examples
Count how many times each category appears (like spam vs not spam).
- Track feature patterns
For each feature (like a word or symptom), count how often it shows up with each category.
- Save what you learned
Store these counts so you can use them to make future guesses.
- Make a guess for new input
For each category, start with its overall count. Then, for each feature in the new input, check how often it matched that category before.
- Pick the best match
Choose the category with the highest combined score.
