# 🧪 Practical: Preparation of Straight-through and Crossover Ethernet Cables

---

## 🔍 Aim
To prepare and test Straight-through and Crossover Ethernet cables using RJ45 connectors for network communication between devices.

---

## 🧰 Requirements
- CAT5e or CAT6 Ethernet cable (UTP)
- RJ45 connectors (8P8C)
- Crimping tool
- Wire stripper
- Cable tester (optional but recommended)
- Color code reference (TIA/EIA-568A and TIA/EIA-568B standards)

## 📘 Theory (5 lines only)
Ethernet cables are used to connect network devices. A **Straight-through cable** connects different devices (e.g., PC to switch), while a **Crossover cable** connects similar devices (e.g., PC to PC). The difference lies in the arrangement of wire pairs. TIA/EIA-568A and 568B are two wiring standards. Straight cables use the same standard on both ends; crossover cables use 568A on one end and 568B on the other.

## 🛠️ Procedure

### 🔹 Step-by-Step for Both Cable Types

1. **Cut the cable** to the desired length using wire cutters.
2. **Strip about 1.5 inches** of the outer jacket from both ends using a wire stripper.
3. **Untwist the wire pairs** and arrange them according to the required standard:
   - **Straight-through**: Use **568B** on both ends.
   - **Crossover**: Use **568A** on one end and **568B** on the other.
4. **Align the wires** flat and trim them evenly to about 0.5 inches.
5. **Insert wires into RJ45 connector** carefully, ensuring each wire goes into its correct slot.
6. **Crimp the connector** using the crimping tool until it clicks securely.
7. **Repeat the process** for the other end of the cable.
8. **Test the cable** using a cable tester to verify correct pin configuration and continuity.
